        <p class="lead mb-4"><br>My name is Christian Gong and I attend UC Riverside College. I am currently a freshman in college. I enjoy talking to people in meeting new friendly faces. I enjoy the outdoors and playing sports and staying active. I would say that I am creative and outgoing. I like to pick up new hobbies in them always open to new ideas. At this point, Iâ€™m not sure what my career goals are but I have registered as a communications and/or sociology major. In terms of social goals in my community, I donâ€™t really have any except being a good role model for the youth and someone that easily approachable and can talk to. Over the course of my first college semester, I have had many successes but just as many mishaps. Perhaps one of my biggest successes is getting above B's on all of my midterms. I achieved this by blocking out time to study and using my time wisely. I went to many different study groups and communicate with my TAs or Professors if I had any questions. I also studied by creating quizlets. By visually seeing each question and answer and being able to isolate the questions I had trouble with, I was able to easily focus on the topics I struggled with. ons I had trouble with, I was able to easily focus on the topics I struggled with. 
A mishap I had was missing an entire quiz because the due date was AM not PM. At the time I was still new to a lot of the interfaces UC Riverside uses and did not know it was due. Another mishap was missing the first part of my geoscience class on the first day. I had been assigned University Village as a lecture hall and thought it was on campus. I initially thought it was held in the lecture hall called University Village.  However, after more investigation, I found out it was an off-campus class held in a movie theatre in the actual University Village. I also had not planned on walking that far and was not prepared with a mode of transportation. 
I will be prepared for the winter quarter because of my new knowledge and experience in canvas and ilearn.ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ I also have gotten used to the changes in my life that come with college. This includes busier weekends and always having a distraction. I have gotten into a productive routine that allows me to hang out with friends every day while still having time to do homework and study.
The steps I have taken to achieve my goals in the first quarter include time management, using my resources, and most importantly exploration. Time management was probably the hardest out of all three steps I've taken. Before coming to college I really struggled with time management; I found myself procrastinating a lot. When I came to college there were so many new people and many things to do that if I had procrastinated I would miss out on a lot of new adventures. This really motivated me as nothing else had in my life. I realized that I was in charge of my own schedule in college and had to start acting more responsibly. 
I used my resources to achieve my goals. I used sources such as Quizlet to help me study for tests. I also used the UCR online database to find a plethora of scholarly sources to help research papers. Lastly, I asked a lot of people for help. If I was unsure of work or had questions about homework I would ask the TA. Also when I wrote essays I had my roommate or friends read them and give me feedback. They often had good advice or constructive criticism that helped elevate my writing. 
Prior to the first quarter, I was feeling nervous about how hard my courses would be and if I would be able to keep up in class. I learned that with the right time management it is possible to stay on top of my work while still making friends. I felt secure in my routine. The only thing that surprised me was how fast quarters are and how soon midterms were. I think this is the first time in two years where I was actively studying. The hybrid worked well for me. I was able to get around to classes. When I make my next quarter schedule I need to make sure to I plan according to the tie it will take me to get around campus. <br>
